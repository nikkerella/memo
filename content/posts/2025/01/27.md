## Microservices and gRPC

gRPC is commonly used in microservices architectures.

### How gRPC runs in a Microservices System

1. Separate Services per host or container
- In a microservices setup, each service (such as "game", "user") should ideally run independently on different hosts or containers. Each service exposes its own gRPC server that listens for RPC requests.
- Each of these services can have their own gRPC server running independently, and they communicate with each other via RPC calls.

2. Service Communication via gRPC
- The services communicate with each other using gRPC:
  - Game Service gRPC server listens for requests about games.
  - User Service gRPC server listens for user-related requests.
  - Game Service can call the User Service to get user data by making an RPC request.

3. Deployment

- Containerized Microservices: You can run each service (Game, User) in a separate Docker container, each exposing its own gRPC server.
- Scaling: With microservices, each service can be scaled independently. If your Game Service is under heavy load, you can scale just that service without affecting the others.
