## sync.Once

> In the terminology of the Go memory model, the return from f "synchronizes before" the return from any call of once.Do(f).

**What does sync.Once do?**
- sync.Once ensures that a function (f) is executed only once across multiple goroutines, no matter how many times Do(f) is called.
- Even if multiple goroutines call Do(f) at the same time, only one goroutine will execute f, and all others will wait until f finishes.

**Synchronizes before?**

- "Synchronizes before" is a guarantee that all effects (changes to memory) of one operation are visible to another operation.
- If one operation (e.g., f) "synchronizes before" another, the results of the first operation are visible and consistent for the second.

[demo for "synchronizes before"](https://github.com/nikkerella/mewtwo-go/tree/master/once)

### [Source Code](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/sync/once.go)

``` go
type Once struct {
    _ noCopy
	done atomic.Uint32
	m    Mutex
}

func (o *Once) Do(f func()) {
	if o.done.Load() == 0 {
		o.doSlow(f)
	}
}

func (o *Once) doSlow(f func()) {
	o.m.Lock()
	defer o.m.Unlock()
	if o.done.Load() == 0 {
		defer o.done.Store(1)
		f()
	}
}
```
