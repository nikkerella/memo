## BFF

- BFF: Backend for Frontend
- Particularly in apps that have multiple client types, such as web, mobile or desktop apps

### How It Works?

 - Call the APIs and get the data
 - Format the data for the specific frontend
 - Send formatted data to the frontend

### Why Use It?

 - Minimize the logic on the frontend
 - Simplified API consumption
 - Separation of concerns
 - Flexibility for multiple frontends

### Differences from Middleware?
- Scope: Middleware handles broader concerns, while BFF focuses on adapting backend data for the frontend.
- Customization: BFF is tailored on the needs of a specific frontend rather than being a general-purpose tool that works for multiple clients.

## Decoupling and SoC

### Decoupling

- Reducing the interdependencies between difference parts of a system.
- Minimizing direct connections between components.
- Example: If the frontend and backend are decoupled, changes in the frontend would not directly affect the backend.

### Separation of Concerns

- Organizing a system into distinct sections, where each section addresses a specific responsibility or concern.
- The goal is to ensure that different parts of the system handle different tasks and logic, without overlapping responsibilities.
- Example: UI concerns, Business logic concerns, Data concerns.
