## How Firebase Messaging Works?

FCM follows a client-server architecture.

### The App Registers with FCM

1. App
  - Initializes Firebase
  - Requests an FCM device token
2. Firebase
  - Returns a unique device token
3. App
  - Sends the token to backend server

### The Server Sends a Push Notification

1. Backend
  - Calls Firebase's FCM API (includes the device token and the message content)
2. Firebase
  - Sends the notification to the app

### The App Receives the Notification

| App State | What Happens? | Handle It Manually |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Foreground | ``onMessageReceived()`` is triggered in FMS | Need to handle it manually |
| Background | shows a notification automatically | ? |
| Killed | ditto | ? |
