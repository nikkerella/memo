## [errgroup](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup)

- A tool for managing groups of goroutines that can return errors.
- A way to handle errors and synchronization in concurrent operations.

Features:
1. Error Propagation: If any goroutine in the group returns an error, the entire group is canceled, and the error is propagated.
2. Context Support: It integrates with Go's context package, allowing you to cancel all goroutines if one fails or if the context is canceled.
3. Synchronization: It ensures that all goroutines in the group complete before the Wait method returns.
