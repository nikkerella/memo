## cancel() of cancelCtx

``` go
func (c *cancelCtx) cancel(removeFromParent bool, err, cause error)
```

**Parameters**
- removeFromParent bool:
  - Determines whether the cancelCtx should be removed from its parent context.
  - If true, the context is detached from its parent, preventing memory leaks.
  -If false, the context remains linked to its parent.
- err error:
  - The error is associated with the cancellation.
  - This is context.Canceled or a custom error.
- cause error:
  - THe reason for the cancellation.
  - Provides additional context about why the cancellation occurred.

**Function Purpose**
- Close the ``done`` channel to signal cancellation.
- Propagates the cancellation to all child contexts.
- Optionally removes the context from its parent's children.
- Sets the cancellation error and cause.

``` go
// cancel closes c.done, cancels each of c's children, and, if
// removeFromParent is true, removes c from its parent's children.
// cancel sets c.cause to cause if this is the first time c is canceled.
func (c *cancelCtx) cancel(removeFromParent bool, err, cause error) {
    // Input validation
    // Ensures that non-nil error is provided. If err is nil,
    // it panics because a cancellation must have an associated error.
	if err == nil {
		panic("context: internal error: missing cancel error")
	}

    // If cause is nil, it defaults to the value of err.
    // This ensures there's always a reason for the cancellation.
	if cause == nil {
		cause = err
	}

	c.mu.Lock()

    // Check if already canceled.
    // If the context is already canceled,
    // the function exits early to avoid redundant work.
	if c.err != nil {
		c.mu.Unlock()
		return // already canceled
	}

	// Set cancellation error and cause.
    c.err = err
	c.cause = cause

    // The done channel is used to signal cancellation.
    // - If the channel is nil, it stores a pre-closed channel (closedchan) to indicate cancellation.
    // - If the channel exists, it closes the channel to notify listeners that the context is canceled.
	d, _ := c.done.Load().(chan struct{})
	if d == nil {
		c.done.Store(closedchan)
	} else {
		close(d)
	}

    // Iterates through all child contexts and cancels them recursively.
	for child := range c.children {
		// NOTE: acquiring the child's lock while holding parent's lock.
        // The false argument ensures that children are not removed from their parent (this context) during cancellation.
		child.cancel(false, err, cause)
	}

    // After canceling all children, the children map is set to nil to release references and prevent memory leaks.
	c.children = nil

	c.mu.Unlock()

    // If removeFromParent is true, the context is detached from its parent to avoid memory leaks.
    // The removeChild function (not shown here) handles the removal logic.
	if removeFromParent {
		removeChild(c.Context, c)
	}
}
