### Load Balancing

- A process of distributing network traffic, computational work, or data processing across multiple servers, resources, or systems to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.
- It helps to achieve better performance, availability, and scalability for applications, especially those with high demand or traffic.

#### Round Robin

- A scheduling algorithm or load balancing method that distributes tasks or requests evenly across a set of resources, such as servers, in a cyclic manner.
- It is one of the simplest and most commonly used algorithms.

How it works?
1. Requests: Incoming requests are received by load balancer.
2. Distribution: The load balancer forwards each request to a different server in a circular or sequential order.
3. Rotation: Once the load balancer reaches the last server in the list, it goes back to the first server and continues the cycle.

Examples:
 - The 1st request is sent to Server A
 - The 2nd request is sent to Server B
 - The 3rd request is sent to Server A
 - The 4th request is sent to Server B

Pros:
 - Simplicity
 - Fair Distribution

Cons:
 - Doesn't account for server load
 - No health check

#### Load and Health

- Load Severity:
  - If the load is high or the system is under heavy resource usage (like CPU or memory), it doesn't necessarily mean the system is "down" or completely non-functional.
  - In stead, Instead, it may slow down or experience delays in processing requests. The system is still running, but it may not be able to respond as quickly, or it may become less efficient in handling additional requests.
  - However, it can still serve requests—just with potential latency or degraded performance.
- Health Severity:
  - If the health of the system is compromised, it will not be able to serve any requests at all.
  - A health failure typically means that the system is not functional, which is a more critical issue than a high load, as it prevents any service from being provided.

### Learn It by Example: How Streaming Apps (Twitch) Work?

1. Streamer Sends Live Data
- The Streamer users a streaming software to capture their screen or camera feed.
- The software sends it to a Twitch server in real-time. The data is uploaded as small chunks or frames (using a protocol like RTMP or HLS)
- The streamer's video/audio encoded into a format suitable for efficient streaming.

2. Twitch Server Processes the Stream
- Once the Twitch server receives the video/audio, it may also handle tasks like transcoding the stream into different resolutions for different viewers.
- Twitch uses multiple servers across regions to ensure viewers get the stream from the nearest server, minimizing latency and buffering.

3. Viewers Download the Stream Data
- The viewers send a request to the Twitch server asking to view the live stream.
- The server sends chunks of the stream data to the viewer's device.
- Twitch adjusts the quality of the stream dynamically depending on the viewer's internet connection.

#### Key Technologies Used

- RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)
- HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
- DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)
- CDN (Content Delivery Network)

#### More Details about CDN

In a CDN, servers are distributed across different geographic locations, and each server caches or holds content close to users in that region.

Geographic IP Direction:
 - When a viewer requests a stream, their IP address is used to determine their geographic location.
 - Based on the geographic info, the CDN will direct the viewer to the nearest server. (KR → KR/JP)

How the CDN works for streaming:
- Localized Content Delivery: Instead of having a single central server that handles all requests, multiple servers located in different regions hold cached versions of the stream or media. This way, viewers can access the content from a server close to them, leading to faster data delivery.
- Load Balancing: The CDN uses load balancing techniques to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed with requests. If the Korean server is too busy, the system may automatically route the user to the Japan server.

Example:
- Korean User: When a user in Korea watches a live stream, the CDN directs them to the closest server in Korea. This minimizes buffering and latency, providing a smoother experience.
- Global Streaming: If the streamer is located in the US and streaming, the CDN will make sure that viewers from Korea, Japan, the US, etc., get the content from the closest server that has cached the stream.
