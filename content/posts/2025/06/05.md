## Spanish

- [ ] Si antes te hubiera conocido.
  - If I had met you earlier.
    - If I had known you before.
  - si = if
  - antes = before / early
  - te = you (object?)
  - hubiera conocido = had known / had met

This is a past unreal conditional, talking about something that didnâ€™t happen, but imagining if it had.
