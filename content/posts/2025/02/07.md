## Relearn OSI

- OSI: Open Systems Interconnection
- A conceptual framework that standardizes network communication into seven layers.
- Each layer has a specific function in the process of transmitting and receiving data.

### OSI Model Layers (Top to Bottom): AP-ST-NDP

1. Application Layer (L7)

- Interface for end-user applications (e.g., web browser, email clients.)
- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FPT, SMTP, DNS

2. Presentation Layer (L6)

- Preparing data for the Application Layer by ensuring that it is in the correct format for the receiving application to process
- It acts as a translator, encryptor, and compressor in a network communication.

Key Functions:

- Data Translation
  - Coverts data between different formats to ensure interoperability between different systems.
    - Example: A Windows-based system might format text differently than a Linux-based system.
- Data Encryption & Decryption
  - Ensures secure communication by encrypting data before transmission and decrypting it upon reception.
    - Example: SSL/TLS (used in HTTPS) encrypts web traffic to protect it from attackers.
- Data Compression & Decompression
  - Reduces the size of data to improve transmission speed and efficiency.
    - Example: Streaming services compress video/audio files to reduce buffering times.
