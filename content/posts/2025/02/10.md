## Relearn OSI

### Transport Layer (L4)

- The Transport Layer is responsible for end-to-end communication, error handling, flow control, and data integrity.
- It ensures that data is transmitted reliably between devices.
- It operates between the Application Layer (L7) and the Network Layer (L3).

#### Key Functions

- End-to-End Communication
  - Ensures that data sent from one device reaches the correct destination.
  - Uses port numbers to distinguish different applications running on a device.
    - Example: HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), SMTP (port 25).
- Multiplexing & Demultiplexing
  - Multiplexing: Allows multiple applications to send data over the same network connection.
  - Demultiplexing: Ensures that received data is delivered to the correct application using port numbers.
  - Example: When you stream a YouTube video while chatting on WhatsApp, both applications send and receive data using different port numbers but share the same network connection.
- Segmentation & Reassembly
  - Segmentation: Splits large data into smaller chunks (segments) for easier transmission.
  - Reassembly: Combines received segments back into the original data.
  - Each segment has a sequence number, ensuring they are correctly reordered upon arrival.
  - Example: If you send a 5GB file over the network, it is broken into smaller packets. The receiver reconstructs them in the correct order using sequence numbers.
- Error Detection & Recovery
  - Uses checksums to detect errors in data transmission.
  - If an error is found, the receiver requests retransmission of the affected segment.
  - Example: If part of an email is corrupted during transmission, the Transport Layer detects it and requests a resend of the faulty segment.
- Flow Control
  - Prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver by adjusting the data transmission speed.
  - Sliding Window Protocol: The sender sends a limited number of packets and waits for an acknowledgment before sending more.
  - Example: If a slow device is receiving data from a fast sender, flow control ensures the sender slows down to avoid packet loss.

#### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable, Connection-Oriented.

- Ensures data is delivered in the correct order.
- Uses ACK (Acknowledgment) & SYN (Synchronization) Handshake.
- Detects and resends lost or corrupted packets.
- Example:
  - Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS).
  - Sending emails (SMTP, IMAP).
  - File transfers (FTP).

**TCP 3-Way Handshake Process (Before Data Transmission)**
1. SYN (Synchronize) – Client requests a connection.
2. SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) – Server acknowledges the request.
3. ACK (Acknowledge) – Connection is established, and data transfer begins.

#### UDP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – Fast, Connectionless.

- Does NOT ensure reliability or order of data delivery.
- No acknowledgment mechanism, so faster but less reliable than TCP.
- Used for applications where speed is more important than reliability.
- Example:
  - Video streaming (YouTube, Netflix, Twitch).
  - Online gaming (Fortnite, but not in Genshin).
  - VoIP calls (Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp calls).

#### About Ports

**What Happens If Two Apps Use the Same Port?**
- Port Conflict (Binding Issue) – If both apps are trying to listen (bind) on the same port, the second app will fail to start or bind to the port. The OS prevents two applications from binding to the same port on the same protocol (TCP or UDP).
- Multiplexing via NAT (For Outgoing Connections) – If both apps are clients sending data from the same port, NAT (Network Address Translation) or the OS can handle it dynamically.

**Ensuring Different Apps Use Different Ports:**
- Operating System Manages Port Allocation
  - When an application requests a port, the OS ensures it is available.
  - If a conflict arises, the OS either blocks the second app or assigns a different dynamic port.
- IANA Port Standardization
  - Well-Known Ports: (0–1023): Reserved for system services (e.g., HTTP = 80, HTTPS = 443).
  - Registered Ports (1024–49151): Used by software vendors (e.g., MySQL = 3306, RDP = 3389).
  - Dynamic Ports (49152–65535): Temporarily assigned by the OS for client applications.

**How Does the OS Ensure Correct Routing?**
Each connection is uniquely identified by:
``[Source IP]:[Source Port] → [Destination IP]:[Destination Port]``
For Example:
| App	| Source Port | Destination IP | Destination Port |
| --- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Chrome | 52001 | 192.168.1.10 | 443 |
| WhatsApp | 53002 | 192.168.1.10 | 443 |
