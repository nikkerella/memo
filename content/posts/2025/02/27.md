## Memory Management

**Software and RAM**
- When a program runs, it requires RAM to:
  - Load its own bytecode: The actual instructions (machine code) that the CPU executes.
  - Store data values and structures: Variables, arrays, objects and other data needed during execution.
  - Load runtime system: Some programs depend on additional libraries, interpreters or runtime environments.

**Why is Stack Memory Fast?**
- The stack follows a LIFO structure, meaning the most recently stored data is retrieved first.
- No complex searching or memory management is need.
- When a function is called, memory is allocated by simply moving the stack pointer (a marker that keeps track of the top of the stack).
- When the function returns, the memory is freed just by moving the stack pointer back.
- This makes the stack very efficient compared to the heap, which requires searching for free memory space and managing allocations.
