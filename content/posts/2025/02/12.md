## OSI: Network Layer (L3)

Handle the routing of data between devices across different networks.

### Key Functions

- Addressing
  - Assigns unique addresses to devices so they can communicate.
  - Uses logical addressing instead of physical addresses.
- Routing
  - Determines the best path for data to travel across networks using routers.
- Packet Forwarding
  - Breaks data into small units called packets.
  - Ensures packets are sent to correct destination based on IP addresses.
- Fragmentation & Reassembly
  - If a packet is too large, it is fragmented into smaller pieces.
  - The receiving device reassembles the fragments into the original data.
- Error Handling & Congestion Control
  - Detects issues in routing and adapts to avoid congested or broken paths.

### Key Protocols

- IP: Internet Protocol
  - Responsible for addressing and routing packets
  - IPv4, IPv6
- ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
  - Used for error reporting and diagnostics (e.g., ``ping`` command.)
- ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
  - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for local networking communication.
- NAT: Network Address Translation
  - Allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address.

### Example of How the Network Layer Works

1. Type ``www.google.com`` into browser.
2. The device sends a request to DNS server to resolve the domain to an IP address.
3. The Network Layer assigns the device an IP address and sends the request to the router.
4. The router uses a routing table to forward the request across the internet. (TODO: routing table?)
5. Google's server receives the request and sends a response back through the same process.

## OSI: Data Link Layer (L2)

- Responsible for node-to-node data transfer.
- It ensures that data is sent and received correctly between directly connected devices.

### Key Functions

- Framing
  - The Data Link Layer encapsulates data into frames before sending it across the network.
  - A frame consists of:
    - Header (source & destination MAC addresses)
    - Payload (actual data from the Network Layer)
    - Trailer (error-checking information)
- MAC Addressing
  - Unlike the Network Layer which uses IP address, the Data Link Layer uses MAC addresses to identify devices.
  - A MAC address is a unique 48-bit address assigned to each network interface card.

## OSI: Physical Layer (L1)

- Handles bit transmission over cables or wireless signals.
- Defines network cables, signal encoding, and transmission speed.
- Works with hubs, repeaters, NICs, and modems.
- Uses encoding and modulation techniques to transmit data.
- Deals with bandwidth, latency, and noise issues

### Key Functions

- Bit Transmission
  - Converts digital data (0s and 1s) into signals (electrical, optical, or radio waves) and transmits them over the medium.
  - At the receiving end, it converts the signals back into digital data.
- Defines Physical Medium
  - Specifies the type of cables, connectors, and wireless technologies used.
  - Examples:
    - Copper cables (Ethernet, coaxial)
    - Fiber optics (Light signals)
    - Radio waves (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth)
- Data Rate (Bit Rate)
  - Determines the speed of data transmission (measured in Mbps or Gbps).
  - Example: Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps).

- congestion
  - traffic congestion, network congestion
