## Big Query

### Big Query?

- A fully managed, serverless, and scalable data warehouse provided by Google Cloud.
- It is designed for analyzing large datasets quickly using SQL and is mainly used for big data analytics and BI (business intelligence).
- A data warehouse optimized for querying large datasets rather than storing transactional data.

### Key Features

- Serverless & Scalable
- Fast SQL Queries
- Supports Massive Datasets

## LLM

### LLM?

- LLM: Large Language Model
- A type of AI model designed to understand, generate and manipulate human language.
- These models are trained on massive datasets and use deep learning techniques, specifically transformers, to process and generate text.

### How?

1. Training Phase
- A large dataset (millions of texts, books or code, etc.) is used to train the model.
- The model does not just store the text but learns patterns, relationships and structures in language.
- The training process uses deep learning to encode knowledge.
- The knowledge is stored as mathematical representations rather than a "large database" of texts.

2. Inference Phase
- When a user asks a question, the model processes the input using its learned knowledge.
- It does not "search" a database like Google but predicts the most likely next words based on patterns it has learned.
- The response is generated dynamically, not retrieved from stored answers.

### An Analogy

- Training Phase: The musician listens to thousands of songs (learning patterns).
- Inference Phase: When asked to play a song they’ve never heard before, they predict the melody based on past experience.

### My Understanding

- A learner and predictor.
- An LLM is like a wise elder who has learned and experienced a lot over their lifetime. When a person asks a question, the elder:
1. Does not retrieve an exact answer from memory like a book.
2. Does not always follow strict rules but instead predicts the best answer based on their lifetime of learning.
3. May not always be 100% correct, but they give an answer based on what they know.
4. If they don’t know something exactly, they still try to make a reasonable guess based on similar past knowledge.

## IaaS

### IaaS?

- IaaS: Infrastructures as Service
- A cloud computing model where virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking).
- Full control.

### Key Features

- Virtual Machines & Containers
- Scalability
- Networking & Security: Firewalls, VPNs and load balancers
- Flexible OS & Softwares

### Examples

## PaaS

### PaaS?

- PaaS: Platform as a Service
- A cloud computing model that provides a ready-to-use platform for developers to build, deploy and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure management.

### Key Features

- Pre-configured Development Environment: Includes OS, runtime, DB and frameworks
- Scalability: Adjusts resources based on demand
- CI/CD

### Examples

- Firebase
- Heroku

## SaaS

### SaaS?

- SaaS: Software as a Service
- A cloud-based software delivery model where applications are hosted by a provider and accessed by users over the internet.
- Instead of installing software on individual devices, users can access it via a web browser.

### Key Features

- Cloud-based: No need for local installation
- Subscription model: Pay monthly or annually
- Scalability: Adjust based on user needs

### Examples

- Netflix
- Microsoft 365
- Salesforce
