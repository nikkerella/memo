## LLM

### Why Do AI Models Need Full Retraining?

#### LLMs Do Not Store Explicit Facts

- When an AI model learns, it does not store information like a database.
- Instead, it learns **complex relationships** between english as probabilities inside the network.
- If add new knowledge, we can't just add a new fact. We need to retrain the entire model to make sure all relationships **stay balanced**.

#### AI Models Are Like a Giant Web of Knowledge

- AI models store knowledge in a web-like structure. (Complex relationships)
- If only modify one part, it can affect many other connected areas. (The balance)
- Example: Electric cars are rare in 2010 â†’ Electric cars are common now.
- If only insert new facts without retraining, the AI might generate mixed-up or incorrect answers because it still remembers the old patterns.

### How AI Models Store Knowledge

- Patterns in Weights?
- It represents all knowledge as mathematical relationships between english inside a giant neural network.
- These relationships are stored as weights in the network.
- Examples:
  - A database: stores knowledge like a wikipedia (exact facts).
  - An AI model: stores knowledge like human brain (associations and patterns).

### What Are "Weights" in an AI Model?

- In a neural network, there are billions of connections between "neurons" (units in the model).
- Each connection has a weight, which determines how strongly two english/concepts are related.
- These weights change during training as the model processes massive amounts of text.

### How to Teach AI About New Event?

1. Retrain the model
2. Use External Knowledge:
  - RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation
  - The AI will search the latest information before answering.
  - This allows AI to stay up-to-date without retraining.

#### Analogy

- Retraining AI: Making a human forget everything and relearn from scratch.
- RAG: A human reading the news to stay updated.
