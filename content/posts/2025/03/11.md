The Japanese word 惜しかった can be translated into Korean in different ways depending on the nuance:
- 아깝다
  - Used when something was close to success but failed, or when something valuable was wasted.
    - もう少しで勝てたのに惜しかったね。→ 조금만 더 하면 이길 수 있었는데 아까웠어.
- 안타깝다
  – Used when feeling regret or pity about an unfortunate situation.
    - 惜しかったけど、負けてしまった。→ 안타깝지만 졌어.
```

- 그 사람은 정말 똑똑해요.
