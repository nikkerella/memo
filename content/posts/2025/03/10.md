## WebRTC

- Web Real-Time Communication
- A technology that enables peer-to-peer communication between web browsers, allowing audio, video, and data sharing directly in the browser without needing plugins or external software.
- It's designed to be simple, secure, and efficient for real-time communication applications like voice calls, video conferences, file transfers, and messaging.

### Key Features

- Peer-to-Peer Communication
  - It allows direct communication between users (peers) over the internet without routing data through a central server. This minimizes latency and bandwidth usage.
- Real-Time Media Streaming
  - It supports high-quality, low-latency audio and video communication. Itâ€™s often used in applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and virtual collaboration tools.
- Data Channel
  - WebRTC provides a data channel for sending arbitrary data (like files, chat messages, or game data) between peers in real-time.
- Built-in Security
  - It uses encryption (like DTLS and SRTP) to ensure that communication is secure by default, protecting users' privacy and data integrity.
