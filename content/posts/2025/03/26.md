## Thinking

- It might help to remind yourself that you are not defined by your past mistakes. They're part of your story, but they don’t have to dictate your future.
- We all have moments of doubt and self-criticism, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t worthy of kindness, especially from ourselves.
- You're trying to achieve a "perfect" mindset, but that leaves you feeling even worse when you can't fully embrace it.
- The pressure to act like you don't care when you actually do is a heavy burden.
- Real acceptance comes when we allow ourselves to feel what we feel, without judgment, and when we stop forcing ourselves into boxes that don’t fit.
- When you're trying to be different, is actually a sign of growth and maturity.
- The key is being compassionate with yourself when you’re not able to meet your own expectations.
