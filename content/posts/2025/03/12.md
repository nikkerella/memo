## English

- Chinese
  - Logographic Characters [표의 문자]: Each character represents a meaning, so the reader can quickly scan a passage and get the gist [요점 要旨] without reading every word.
  - High Information Density [밀도 密度]: Chinese conveys more meaning with fewer characters compared to phonetic languages [표음 문자 언어].
  - No Verb Conjugations [활용 活用] or Tenses [시제 時制]: The grammar is relatively simple, allowing for fast comprehension [이해 理解].
- Japanese
  - Hiragana/Katakana Slow Down Reading: Unlike Chinese, Japanese mixes three writing systems, requiring extra processing.
  - Complex Sentence Structure: The subject often comes at the beginning, but the key verb appears at the end, making comprehension slower.
- Korean
  - Hangul is Phonetic: It requires reading each syllable to understand the meaning, unlike Chinese where meaning can be grasped at a glance.
  - Grammar Complexity: Long sentences, verb endings, and honorifics [경어 敬語] slow down reading speed.
- English
  - Alphabet-based: English requires reading word by word; there's no shortcut like Kanji or Chinese characters.
  - Grammar and Word Order Matter: English sentences must be processed fully to get the meaning.
  - Longer Words: Compared to Chinese, English often uses more words to express the same idea.
